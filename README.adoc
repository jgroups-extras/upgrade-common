= Rolling upgrades of a JGroups cluster

This document describes how to upgrade a JGroups cluster to a new, incompatible version,
or a new configuration. The term _incompatible_ means that the nodes running on the new version
(or configuration) would be unable to form a cluster with the existing nodes.

Upgrading a cluster to a new version is critical for some customers, who cannot afford downtime.

The design is influenced by how Kubernetes applies a new configuration: it adds a new pod, running with the new
configuration, then kills off an existing one, until all existing pods have been replaced.


== Overview

Say we have a cluster `{A1,A2,A3}`. A rolling upgrade might proceed as follows:

* `{A1,A2,A3}`
* New node `B1` is started in a separate cluster: `{A1,A2,A3} {B1}`
* An existing node is killed: `{A1,A3} {B1}`
** Note that we don't know (in Kubernetes) which node is killed
* And so on:
* `{A1,A3} {B1,B2}`
* `{A3} {B1,B2}`
* `{A3} {B1,B2,B3}`
* `{B1,B2,B3}`

=== Goals

There are 2 goals for the above scenario:

. There needs to be a _global view_ of all nodes; ie. instead of the 2 separate
cluster views `{A1,A2,A3}` and `{B1}`, the global view should be the virtual view `{A1,A2,A3,B1}`.
. Members of the different clusters must be able to talk to each other; a.k.a. send
(unicast and multicast) messages to each other. In the above example, `A2` should be able to send
a message to `B1`.


=== Design

In order to achieve the above goals, all application messages are sent to a JGroups-independent
server (the _UpgradeServer_), which relays them to all registered cluster nodes, as shown below:

----
                    -----------------
                    | UpgradeServer |
                    -----------------
                           ^
                           |
                           |
        ---------------------------------
        |      |        |         |      |
        |      |        |         |      |
        v      v        v         v      v
      ----    ----    ----      ----   ----
      |A1|    |A2|    |A3|      |B1|   |B2|
      ----    ----    ----      ----   ----

Each node knows the address of the UpgradeServer and registers with it by establishing a TCP connection.
The UpgradeServer maintains a table of clusters mapped to nodes belonging to them.

When a message is received from one of the nodes, the UpgradeServer forwards the message to registered
nodes (multicast message), or to an individual node (unicast message).

NOTE: When talking about messages above, we're not referring to `org.jgroups.Message`, but instead to
simple `byte[]` arrays, which are version-independent.

The server also installs _virtual views_ in all registered nodes when a new node joins. This gives
the application the illusion of a global cluster with both existing and new members in the same
view. This is needed for example by Infinispan to compute the consistent hash wheel correctly, and
perform correct data rebalancing when (e.g.) `B1` is started.

NOTE: It is paramount that the communication protocol between a node and the UpgradeServer is well-defined
and never changes, so that different versions of JGroups can talk to the same UpgradeServer.

The communication on the client (cluster node) side is performed by `UPGRADE`:

----
            Application
                 ^
                 |
                 | (send, receive)
                 |
                 v
            -----------         (forward,receive)          -----------------
            | UPGRADE | <------------------------------->  | UpgradeServer |
            -----------   (JGroups-independent protocol)   -----------------
            |  FRAG3  |
            -----------
            | NAKACK2 |
            -----------
            |    ...  |
            -----------

`UPGRADE` is added at the top of the stack. When active, it forwards all application messages to the
UpgradeServer, instead of sending them down the stack. When not active, messages are not forwarded to the
server, but simply sent down the stack.

When it receives a message from the UpgradeServer, it passes it up the stack to the application.

When a cluster member joins, `UPGRADE` will get the view of the local cluster (e.g. `{A1,A2,A3}`)
from below. It stores the local view, but does not pass it up to the application. Instead, it asks
the UpgradeServer to add it to the current global view. The UpgradeServer then creates a new global
virtual view and sends it to all registered cluster members. Their `UPGRADE` protocols send that
global view up the stack to the application.

This means, that applications with a stack that has `UPGRADE` at the top will never receive cluster-local
views, but only global views created by the UpgradeServer.

The communication protocol between `UPGRADE` and UpgradeServer needs to be well-defined and should never
change, so that different JGroups versions can talk to the server as long as their `UPGRADE` protocol
implements the communication protocol correctly.

Since an `UPGRADE` protocol is specific to a given JGroups version, it resides in a separate project, e.g.
https://github.com/jgroups-extras/upgrade-jgroups (`UPGRADE` for JGroups 5.2.x).

This design is similar to `RELAY` (https://github.com/belaban/JGroups/blob/master/src/org/jgroups/protocols/RELAY.java),
but uses an external UpgradeServer and a version agnostic communication protocol to talk to it,
so that different JGroups versions can talk to each other (via UpgradeServer).




=== Example of a rolling upgrade

Say we have cluster members `{A1,A2,A3}`, running on JGroups 3.6. We want to upgrade them to version
4.x, resulting in a cluster `{B1,B2,B3}`. The following steps need to be taken when running on
Kubernetes:

* A new service/pod needs to be started with the UpgradeServer. It runs on a given address and port.
* The 3.6 configuration is changed to contain `UPGRADE` at the top. (If already present, this and the
next step can be skipped). Alternatively, `UPGRADE` can be added to the existing cluster members
dynamically via `probe.sh` (see the JGroups manual for details).
** Note that `UPGRADE` is configured to be inactive, so no messages are relayed, and no global
views are installed.
* `kubectl apply` is executed to update all cluster members to a 3.6 configuration that contains
`UPGRADE`.
* Once this is done, `UPGRADE` in all cluster members is configured to be active. This can be done
via the UpgradeServer sending an `ACTIVATE` command to the cluster members. From now one, virtual
global views and message relaying is enabled.
* `kubectl apply` is executed *to apply a new configuration*. The new configuration points to an image
with JGroups 4.x (the existing cluster members are running on 3.6), and possibly a new JGroups config.
* Kubernetes starts a new pod with the new config and then kills off an existing node (as described
in the overview section).
** The new config includes an _active_ `UPGRADE` protocol at the top of the stack
* When members are added/killed, a new global view will be installed via UpgradeServer
* When all members have been updated to the new version, a `DEACTIVATE` command is sent to all cluster members,
which de-activate `UPGRADE` (or even remove it from the stack).
* The UpgradeServer pod can now safely be killed.


=== Using secure connections
By default, `UpgradeServer` and the clients (`UPGRADE` protocols) use plaintext gRpc connections. This can be changed,
so that communication between server and clients is encrypted. To do this, 3 steps have to be taken:

. Generate a certificate and a private/public key pair for the server and clients to use
* This can be done with `bin/genkey.sh`: this generates `server.cert` and `server.key`
** Make sure you set the hostname (in `genkey.sh`) to the host on which `UpgradeServer` will be running.
* Of course, in a production environment, self-signed certificates should not be used!
. Run UpgradeServer with the key and certificate
* Pass options `-cert <path-to-certificate>` and `-key <path-to-key>` to `UpgradeServer`.
. Set `server_cert` in `UPGRADE` to point to the server's certificate (generated above)
* `<UPGRADE server_cert="/home/user/certs/server.cert" />`

=== Restrictions
Applications wanting to use rolling upgrades have to take certain restrictions into account:

* Only `BytesMessage` is currently (as of Jan 2024) supported. `NioMessage` should work, but has not yet been tested
* `RELAY3`
** Currently, only a subset of JGroups headers is supported: `ForkHeader`, `RelayHeader`, `UnicastHeader` and `RequestCorrelator.Header`
** If `RELAY3` resides below other protocols, then - depending on the protocol type - those headers will also
have to be supported, e.g. `FragHeader`. There is currently no way to suppor headers in a generic way
